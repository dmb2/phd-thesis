The $J/\psi$ particle has been the source of much research since its
discovery in 1974. It provides an important probe of quantum
chromodynamics and has lead to many important insights into the
interactions of quarks and gluons in bound states. The rate of
production was found to be much higher than expected at hadron
colliding experiments. Non-relativistic quantum chromodynamics was
developed in order to address these issues. This theory predicts a
strong spin-alignment not observed in data. All previous measurements
of $J/\psi$ production have overlooked the hadronic environment of the
$J/\psi$. This work is the first exploration of the radiation
surrounding $J/\psi$ events measured at ATLAS at
$\sqrt{s}=8~\text{TeV}$. It represents the first measurement of the
separation between the $J/\psi$ and a matched jet and the second
measurement of the momentum fraction shared between the jet and the
$J/\psi$. These variables probe the radiation environment around the
$J/\psi$, and provide a new ways to understand quarkonia production.
