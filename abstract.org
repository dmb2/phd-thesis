The lack of agreement between the measured polarization in prompt
J/$\psi$ events when including color octet contributions is referred
to as the ``polarization puzzle.''  The radiation environment around
quarkonia production remains unstudied in an experimental setting.
This work is the first exploration of the radiation surrounding
charmonium events measured at ATLAS at $\sqrt{s}=8~\text{TeV}$. Recent
theoretical developments in NRQCD calculations suggest that the
fraction of momentum shared between a jet and the J/$\psi$ is
sensitive to color singlet and color octet production of prompt
J/$\psi$ events. This work presents the first measurement of the
separation between the $J/\psi$ and a matched jet, the matched jet's
N-subjettiness, and the momentum fraction shared between the jet and
the $J/\psi$. These variables probe the radiation environment around
the $J/\psi$, and provide a new ways to understand quarkonia
production.
