This work is the realization of a goal that I've had since I was a
sophomore in high school. My love of science started much earlier with
a set of encyclopedia's for children given to me by my grandmother,
Alice Ganksop. Without her and my parent's (Martin and Lisa Bjergaard)
support, my love of science wouldn't have grown to give me the
dedication required to complete a PhD. As a high school student, two
educators stand out as having significant influence on my path to a
PhD in physics: Don Haufschild, my physics teacher and David McDowell,
my pre-calculus teacher. As an undergraduate, I was significantly
influenced by Petar Maksimovic and Salvatore Rappoccio, both of which
formed the foundation of research skills that I've continued to use
and hone throughout my PhD. The constant support of my wife, Swarnali
Sengupta Bjergaard (also a PhD student) has allowed me to grow in ways
I did not know were possible. Both of our parents have given us
countless hours of guidance in managing our work-life balance as well
as problem solving many problems related to research and otherwise.
Finally, Sean and Heather Finch have been a constant source of social
support as we finish our degrees. They are always there for us when we
want to decompress after a tough week, and understand the hard work it
takes to complete a PhD. Professionally I have benefited from many of
my peers as well as people who have mentored me to become a better
physicist. Chris Pollard and Ben Cerio were especially helpful in the
early years of my PhD for helping me solve problems with analysis. Ben
always kept me on my toes and helped me see the possibility of moving
beyond an academic career path. My sub-group conveners, Bruce Yabsly
and Andrew Chisholm, in the B and Light States Group have constantly
challenged me to approach my work rigorously and to communicate
clearly. Every one of their suggestions has made my analysis stronger.
I have become a physicist under the mentoring and guidance of Ayana
Arce. She has encouraged me to follow non-standard research paths and
think independently even prior to accepting my position at Duke. She
encouraged me to teach and mentor students and provided me with ample
professional development. She has always supported my choices and
helped me make the tough decision to explore a career outside of
academia. I owe everyone above a large drink of their choice, and am
happy to provide it, you need only ask.
