* A brief history
The history of particle physics spans over a century of experimental
and theoretical development that has lead to some of the deepest
insights into nature. The starting point for this work began during
the post-war period of the early 1950s. A series of bubble chamber
experiments led to the discovery of the $\Lambda$, $\Xi$ and $\Sigma$
baryons[fn::Baryons are bound states of three quarks. The name is
derived from the greek word "heavy" or "barus" ]. This coupled with
the discoveries of the $K$, $\pi$ and $\eta$ mesons[fn:: Mesons are
bound states of a quark and an anti-quark. The name is derived from
the greek word "intermediate" or "mesos" ] lead to the proposal of the
"eightfold way" \cite{PhysRev.125.1067}. The guiding principal of the
eightfold way is to use the structure of a proposed $SU(3)\times
SU(3)$ symmetry to explain the mesons and baryons known to date and to
make strong predictions about new states that should be observed
\cite{PhysRev.125.1067}. This organization of the particles hints at
the existence of fundamental particles called /quarks/.

While the eightfold way provided an organizational scheme and strong
predictions of the relationships between the members of the baryon
octet, experimental evidence for the existence of quarks came later.
In 1971, Feynman published what is now known as the parton[fn:: Parton
so called for being a "part" of the hadron. Also rumored to be named
after Dolly Parton, the country singer\cite{ashone}. ] model of the
hadron \cite{PhysRevD.3.2706}. This model treated the components of
the hadron as fundamental particles with physical properties. This is
in contrast with the quark model of the eightfold way which did not
describe quarks as physical particles. The parton model described many
experimental results to a reasonable degree however there were some
issues, namely a "fudge factor" to bring the calculations close enough
to their experimental values to be compared \cite{PhysRevD.3.2706}.

The eightfold way and the parton model provided two complementary
views of the structure of the hadron. The eightfold way provided a
computational framework that was successful in describing many
observed patterns in the quantum numbers of the known hadrons. The
parton model provided a physical picture for the structure of the
hadron. Neither model provided a precise description of the underlying
dynamics of the strong interaction.

In November, 1973 Wilczek and Gross published their seminal paper on
asymptotically free gauge theories \cite{PhysRevD.8.3633}. This paper
laid the groundwork for what would become quantum chromodynamics (QCD)
the theory underpinning the subject of this thesis. A year later in
1974 the discovery of a new particle was announced independently by a
group at Brookhaven National Lab (named the $J$) and a group at the
Stanford Linear Accelerator (named the $\psi$)
\cite{PhysRevLett.33.1404}\cite{PhysRevLett.33.1406}. The joint
discovery of the J/\psi lead to what is known colloquially as the
"November revolution." The new particle provided a new piece of
experimental evidence that confirmed the picture of quarks and helped
to unravel the mysteries of the strong interaction.

We now understand that hadrons are made up of quarks and gluons
(partons in Feynman's parlance). In addition, the bound state of a
quark and anti-quark of the same flavor are referred to as quarkonium.
This name is reminiscent of positronium, the eletromagnetically bound
state of a positron and electron. Many of the salient features of
quarkonium mass spectrum can be understood with non-relativistic
quantum mechanics and emperical models of the QCD potential. Even with
this deep understanding of nature's fundamental interactions, the
J/\psi particle continues to perplex and confuse our understanding of
QCD. In 1992, the CDF collaboration at the Tevatron reported the first
measurement of J/\psi and \psi(2S) production. They found the rate of
production to be an order of magnitude more than the expectation from
theory \cite{Abe:1992ww}. Two years later, Bodwin, Braaten and Lepage
worked out many of the details of quarkonium production in QCD using
effective field theory\cite{Bodwin:1994jh}.

In 1997, the Tevatron updated its observation of the \psi system with
more data. It reported the differential cross section of the J/\psi to
be much higher than anticipated by the leading order theory
calculation for singlet production \cite{PhysRevLett.79.572}. The
details worked out by Bodwin et al positioned the theory community to
quickly calculate the needed contributions from the non-relativistic
expansion of QCD (NRQCD) in order to describe the data
\cite{PhysRevD.55.R5269}.

The extra NRQCD components that describe the observed transverse
momentum spectrum predicted that the spin alignment between the J/\psi
and the decaying muons be strongly polarized. Subsequent measurements
of the polarization at CDF find no evidence of polarized
spin-alignment in the J/\psi system \cite{PhysRevLett.85.2886}. This
problem has been dubbed the "polarization puzzle" in literature and
has no satisfying explanation nearly two decades after its first
observation.

The production of charm quark pairs which transition to the J/\psi
state probes two complementary energy scales. The origination of the
pair happens during the primary interaction of two partons. This is a
high energy interaction, and can be calculated using perturbation
theory. After the pair of quarks is produced, their relative motion
determines the dynamics of the bound state. This is at a much lower
energy scale and is non-perturbative. Handling these two scales is the
major theoretical challenge to calculating a quantitative cross
section for quarkonium production.

While there has been much theoretical work to understand J/\psi
production, experimental approaches have mainly focused on measuring
the differential production cross section of isolated, directly
produced J/\psi particles. Little to no attention has been paid to the
hadronic environment surrounding the charmonium system. If the
charmonium is produced in a color singlet state, the surrounding
radiation should be less than a charmonium state in a color octet
state.  

A useful phenomenological model employed by Pythia [fn:: A generic
Monte Carlo simulation program used in High Energy Physics] is to
consider the charmonium system as a color-charged particle which can
couple to gluons using rules of QCD \cite{Sjostrand:2007gs}. As this
particle propogates it emits co-linear gluon radiation according to a
splitting function for the process $q\rightarrow q g$. When the
composite particle falls below a certain threshold, it transitions to
a color singlet J/\psi hadron and emits the remaining color charge as
a soft gluon which is incorporated into the underlying event. This is
in contrast to color singlet production which has the J/\psi produced
directly and no net color charge.

An alternative view of charmonium production is the production of the
charm quark pair during the fragmentation of partons into individual
hadrons. In the fragmenting jet function (FJF)
framework \cite{Procura:2009vm}, the total cross section is a product
of the short distance partonic cross section with universal
fragmentation functions which determine the evolution of individual
partons to hadrons.

The FJF framework differs from the Pythia model in how it treats the
distribution of radiation around the charmonium system.  In the FJF
approach, a high energy gluon splits according to a splitting function
for $g\rightarrow g g$, which is very different from Pythia's model
which allows the charmonium system to radiate according to a splitting
function for $q \rightarrow q g$.  This leads to fundamentally
different distributions of momentum between the surrounding radiation
and the charmonium system \cite{Bain:2016clc}.  

The following is a birds-eye view of the remainder of the thesis. Chapter
\ref{chap:theory} presents an overview of Quantum Chromodynamics, and
the phenomena relevant for this work. Following that Chapter
\ref{chap:detector} describes the LHC and ATLAS detector in detail.
After describing the detecting apparatus, the methods of
reconstructing jets and J/\psi candidates is described in
\ref{chap:reconstruction}. With a firm grasp of the theory and
physical measurement of the particles, the next step is a description
of the data analysis methods used in Chapter \ref{chap:analysis}. In
Chapter \ref{chap:measurement} the selection criteria, systematic
errors, and final results are presented. A discussion of consequences
and future work follows.

* Quantum Chromodynamics
Quantum chromodynamics describes the interactions between quarks and
gluons. It is one of the fundamental pieces of the Standard Model of
Physics, and has provided fertile ground for experimental and
theoretical work. The interactions of QCD are determined by the SU(3)
symmetry group. Under this symmetry quarks have a color charge
($a=1,2,3$). While quarks carry a color charge, they must form color
neutral particles. Therefore, it is useful to assign the colors red,
green, and blue to the color index in order to provide intuition for
which states are allowed. Quarks paired with color conjugated quarks
(green with anti-green, red with anti-red etc) form the mesons.
Triplet pairs of quarks with an anti-symmetric combination of red,
green, and blue form color neutral baryons. Other more exotic
combinations are allowed but they must follow the constraint that the
state be color neutral.
** Quark Flavor
In addition to carrying color charge, quarks carry a flavor. The
Standard Model consists of three generations of quarks. Each
generation consists of a flavor doublet with charge 2/3 and charge
-1/3. Quarks with charge 2/3(-1/3) are referred to as up(down)-type
quarks. In each generation, the mass of the quarks are successively
larger. In the first generation, the up and down quarks are a few MeV.
The strange and charm quark masses differ by a factor of 10. The
strange quark mass is approximately 100 MeV, while the charm quark
mass is near 1 GeV. In the third and final generation, the bottom
quark is 4 GeV, and the top quark is forty times larger at 173 GeV
\cite{Agashe:2014kda}. The quantum numbers of the individual quarks
determine the properties of the composite baryons and mesons.
** Lagrangian
The formulation of a quantum theory for quark interactions requires a
lagrangian which contains interaction terms which satisfy the SU(3)
symmetry group. The following summarizes the results in chapter 1 of
"QCD and Collider Physics" \cite{Ellis:1991qj}, for further details
the reader is referred to that text.

In order to derive a quantum theory, begin by writing the QCD
lagrangian in terms of a classical field plus a gauge fixing term, and
a ghost term.
#+BEGIN_LaTeX
  \begin{equation*}
    \mathcal{L}_{\text{QCD}}=\mathcal{L}_{\text{Classical}}+\mathcal{L}_{\text{Gauge}} + \mathcal{L}_{\text{Ghost}}
  \end{equation*}
#+END_LaTeX
In natural units ($\hbar=c=1$), the classical field lagrangian is:
#+BEGIN_LaTeX
  \begin{equation}
  \label{eq:qcd-classic}
    \mathcal{L}_{\text{Classical}} = -\frac{1}{4}F^A_{\alpha\beta}F^{\alpha\beta}_A + \sum_{\text{flavors}}\overline{q}_a(i\slashed{D}-m)_{ab}q_b
  \end{equation}
#+END_LaTeX
Here $\slashed{D}\equiv\gamma_\mu D^\mu$, and $F_{\alpha\beta}^A$ is
the gluon field strength tensor:
#+BEGIN_LaTeX
  \begin{equation}
  \label{eq:qcd-tensor}
    F_{\alpha\beta}^A =
    \partial_\alpha\mathcal{A}_\beta^A-\partial_\beta\mathcal{A}_\alpha^A - g f^{ABC}\mathcal{A}_\alpha^B\mathcal{A}_\beta^C
  \end{equation}
#+END_LaTeX
The color indices $A,B,C$ run over the eight generators of the SU(3)
group. The constant $g$ represents the coupling strength, and the
constants $f^{ABC}$ are the structure constants of SU(3). It is this
term which distinguishes QCD from quantum electrodynamics (QED). In
order to derive the Feynman rules for QCD, the path integral of the
action must be evaluated. In the standard formulation of the action,
the resulting integral is badly divergent because of the gauge
invariance of the theory \cite{Peskin:1995ev} [fn:: See 9.4
Quantization of the Electromagnetic Field]. Following the
Faddeev-Popov method of gauge fixing used in \cite{Ellis:1991qj} the
following two terms are added to the lagrangian:
#+BEGIN_LaTeX
  \begin{align}
    \mathcal{L}_{\text{Gauge}} &= -
    \frac{1}{2\lambda}(\partial^\alpha\mathcal{A}_\alpha^A)^2 \\
    \mathcal{L}_{\text{Ghost}} &= \partial_\alpha\eta^{A\dagger}(D^\alpha_{AB}\eta^B)
  \end{align}
#+END_LaTeX
These terms serve to constrain the integral over the action to
physical configurations exactly once \cite{Peskin:1995ev}. 
** Feyman Rules
The Feynman rules for QCD can be determined from the lagrangian by
finding the action ($S = \int \mathcal{L} d^4x$)and writing it in
terms of a free field lagrangian $S_0$ and an interacting term $S_I$:
#+BEGIN_LaTeX
  \begin{equation*}
  S = S_0 + S_I
  \end{equation*}
#+END_LaTeX
Further by identifying $\partial^\alpha = -ip^\alpha$ as the momentum
it is possible to write down the two point function for the quarks and
gluons. This results in the Feynman rules shown in Figure
\ref{fig:qcd-feyn-rules}.
#+CAPTION: Feynman rules for QCD, see \cite{Ellis:1991qj} for more details.
#+NAME: fig:qcd-feyn-rules
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width \linewidth
[[file:figures/qcd_rules.eps]]

Combined, these rules allow the creation of any relativistic quark
interactions allowed by the theory of QCD.  There are two aspects of
QCD which distinguish it from QED. 

The first is the running of the coupling constant, $\alpha_S$. In QED,
the coupling constant is higher at high energies. This running of the
coupling constant can be understood by examining the state of the
vacuum around the electric charge. At high energies, and short
distances, there is less screening of the true charge of the electron
due to vacuum polarization. This polarization arises due to dipole
pairs of virtual electrons and positrons which screen the charge of
the electron. This leads to a coupling constant which is larger than
at low energies. In QCD, the coupling constant decreases at high
energy.  This phenomenon is known as asymptotic freedom.  At very high
energies, the coupling between quarks becomes so low that they become
free particles.  It is difficult to understand this from the vacuum of
QCD, but it is possible to make analogies to the paramagnetic
properties of the vacuum \cite{Ellis:1991qj}. 

The second feature is the self-interaction of the gluon.  In QED, the
mediating photon has no electric charge, and thus does not couple to
itself.  In QCD, the gluon carries color charge. This means that the
field doesn't spread uniformly out from the quark, instead it forms
tube-like structures.  At some point, the potential energy stored in
the self-interacting gluon tubes becomes so high that it is
energetically favorable to create a quark anti-quark pair from the
vacuum than it is to increase the distance between two quarks further.
This property of QCD is referred to as confinement. 
* Quarkonium
The bound states and their properties are important to any theory of
interactions. In QCD, bound states consist of mesons and baryons in
accordance with the rules outlined in Section [[Feyman Rules]]. When a
meson forms a bound state with a quark and anti-quark of the same
flavor it is referred to as a quarkonium state. This naming scheme is
reminiscent of the positronium bound state from quantum mechanics in a
coulomb potential. Quarkonium have a number of unique properties that
make it an ideal system to study properties of QCD. The bound state
consists of a quark and its charge-conjugate. This provides a degree
of symmetry not present in other meson systems. In heavy quarkonium
systems (charmonium and bottomonium), the mass scale is high enough
that perturbation theory can provide useful answers relative to the
cutoff energy scale $\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}\simeq 450~\text{MeV}$. The
strength of the coupling strength of QCD in the charmonium system is
$\alpha_s(m_c)\approx0.24$ \cite{Bodwin:1994jh}. This is large enough
that the perturbation series converges more slowly than one would
hope. The higher mass of the bottom quark allows the bottomonium
system a faster rate of convergence. At the bottom mass scale,
$\alpha_s(m_b)\approx0.18$ \cite{Bodwin:1994jh}.

Before examining the consequences of a larger $\alpha_s$ in the
charmonium system, it is useful to reproduce as much of the charmonium
spectrum using quantum mechanics. An important aspect of quarkonium
production at high energies in hadronic collisions is the interplay of
multiple energy scales. At very high energies, production is dominated
by the fragmentation of gluons into pairs of charm quarks. The gluon
recoils from a primary interaction with a gluon or quark in the
proton-proton collision. The energy scale which determines the
production of the quark pair is the mass of the heavy quark $M$.

In the rest frame of the quarkonia's constituent quarks the relative
velocity ($v$) of the quarks is the important scale. This means their
relative momentum ($Mv$) is important for the dynamics of the
quarkonium's propagation and subsequent decay. The final quantity
which determines the dynamics of the system is the kinetic energy
($Mv^2$) of the quarks. The kinetic energy determines the size of the
radial excitations in the system \cite{Bodwin:1994jh}. It is assumed
that these scales are well separated in the sense that $(Mv^2)^2 <<
(Mv)^2 << M^2$ \cite{Bodwin:1994jh}.

** Positronium System
A treatment of the positronium system can be found in any
undergraduate treatment of bound states allowed by the Coulomb
potential \cite{Townsend:2000modern} \cite{Griffiths:2008zz}. A brief
review of the important results are presented. The content of this
section follows that of \cite{Ellis:1991qj}. The existence of a
solution is due to the spherical symmetry of the coulomb potential.
This allows the system to be solved by separation of variables and
reduces the degrees of freedom to finding the one dimensional bound
states due to the coulomb potential:
#+BEGIN_LaTeX
  \begin{equation*}
    U(r) = - \alpha/r
  \end{equation*}
#+END_LaTeX
Here $\alpha$ is the dimensionless fine structure constant, and takes
a value of 1/137. The wavefunction is then written as:
#+BEGIN_LaTeX
\begin{equation}
\psi(r,\theta,\phi) = R_{l,n}(r)Y^m_l(\theta,\phi)
\end{equation}
#+END_LaTeX
Here $R_{l,n}(r)$ is the radial solution, and $Y^m_l(\theta,\phi)$ are
the spherical harmonic functions. The spherical harmonics $Y^m_l$
arise from requiring angular momentum conservation. The radial
functions are determined by finding the solutions to the
time-independent Shroedinger equation. The energy eigenvalues are the
well known Bohr energy levels:
#+BEGIN_LaTeX
\begin{equation}
E_n = - \frac{\mu\alpha^2}{2n^2}
\end{equation}
#+END_LaTeX
Here $\mu$ is the reduced mass of the system[fn:: $\mu\equiv
\frac{m_1m_2}{m_1+m_2}$, In the case of positronium this is $m_e/2$].
The characteristic length scale of the system is the Bohr radius:
#+BEGIN_LaTeX
  \begin{equation}
  a_0 = \frac{1}{\mu \alpha}
  \end{equation}
#+END_LaTeX
The ground state wave function is ($n=1,l=0,m=0$) \cite{Townsend:2000modern}:
#+BEGIN_LaTeX
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:1S1}
\psi_{100}(r,\theta,\phi) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi a_0^3}}e^{-r/a_0}
\end{equation}
#+END_LaTeX
The first radial excited state is ($n=2,l=1,m=0$) \cite{Townsend:2000modern}:
#+BEGIN_LaTeX
  \begin{equation}
  \label{eq:3P0}
  \psi_{210}(r,\theta,\phi) = \frac{1}{4\sqrt{2\pi a_0^3}}\frac{r}{a_0}e^{-r/(2a_0)}\cos\theta
  \end{equation}
#+END_LaTeX
These two states are important because they correspond to the first
two excitations in the charmonium spectrum. At this point it is useful
to introduce the spectroscopic notation used in quarkonia literature.
The notation follows that of atomic spectroscopy: $^{2S+1}L_J$. Here
$S$ is the total spin of the system, $L$ is the orbital quantum
number, and $J$ is total angular momentum. In the case of positronium,
and quarkonium, the constituent particles are spin-1/2. Therefore when
they are combined $S$ can take the values of 0 or 1. The orbital
angular quantum number $L$ follows the time-honored notation where
$L=0,1,2,3,\ldots$ corresponds to the letters $S,P,D,F,\ldots$.
Finally, $J$ takes the values $J=|L-S|,\ldots,L+S$.

Up to this point the positronium system and the quarkonium system have
been treated as interchangeable. In fact, if gluons did not
self-interact, the QED potential and the QCD potential would be the
same modulo coupling constants and a numerical factor for color. This
similarity suggests that using the hydrogen-like wave-functions as a
basis state and applying perturbation theory may prove fruitful.
** Potential Models of QCD
It is not an accident that the potential model of QCD works well to
describe the distribution of bound states observed in quarkonium
systems. First, the gluon interaction times are much shorter than the
movement time scale of the quarks. This is due to the assumption that
the kinetic energy, $Mv^2$ is much smaller than the momentum of the
quarks, $Mv$ \cite{Bodwin:1994jh}. This means that treating the quarks
as though they exist in an instantaneous potential is a good
approximation. The second reason potential models are successful is
the fact that the probability of another gluon existing in the bound
state is small \cite{Bodwin:1994jh}.

Using a the coulomb eigenfunctions as a set of basis states and
applying a perturbative potential provides a good description of the
quarkonium spectrum. The perturbation used is due to the
self-interaction of the gluons. 
#+BEGIN_LaTeX
\begin{equation*}
V(r)=Kr
\end{equation*}
#+END_LaTeX 
Here $K$ is the "string constant".  This term combined with the
coulomb-like potential:
#+BEGIN_LaTeX
  \begin{equation*}
    U(r) = - \frac{4}{3}\frac{\alpha_s}{r}
  \end{equation*}
#+END_LaTeX
completes the model. The perturbation is confining at large distances
and presents a constant force. The string analogy is apt, as the
tension in a string is constant. When the force applied exceeds the
tensile strength of the string, the string snaps. This analogy
suggests the string model of fragmentation in which the gluon
"strings" snap and quark anti-quark pairs form at the ends of the
strings.
#+CAPTION: Spectrum of charmonium and bottomonium bound states compared to potential theory \cite{Ellis:1991qj}.  
#+NAME: fig:spectrum
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width \linewidth :options angle=-90
[[file:figures/quarkonium_spectrum.eps]] 

Figure \ref{fig:spectrum} shows the result of applying a more
sophisticated potential model as a perturbation on the coulomb-like
eigenfunctions. This model has the asymptotic features of the string
model and describes the data well \cite{Ellis:1991qj}.  The dashed
lines are the theory prediction and the solid lines are the data.  The
bottomonium spectrum is better described because the mass is higher,
and hence the coupling constant is weaker making the assumptions
behind the potential model stronger. 
* Non-relativistic QCD
While the potential model of QCD bound states does a good job of
capturing the features of the spectrum it is not a complete
description. Figure \ref{fig:spectrum} shows some disagreement in the
numerical values for the mass eigenstates. Further, the potential
model offers no way of calculating the differential cross section for
production. This can be done using perturbation theory with the
relativistic QCD lagrangian. The leading order cross sections for
J/\psi production were calculated in the early 80s
\cite{Baier:1983va}. After the measurement of the J/\psi and \psi(2S)
by the Tevatron in the early 90s, the disparity between the leading
order prediction and the measured data was large. This lead to the
exploration of effective field theory descriptions of QCD in an
attempt to bridge the gap between the non-perturbative parts of
quarkonia processes which are difficult to calculate and the parts of
quarkonia production amenable to perturbation theory
\cite{Bodwin:1994jh}.
** Lagrangian
Rather than take an explicit expansion of the QCD Lagrangian
(\ref{eq:qcd-classic}), it is informative to build a Lagrangian which
is equivalent to the fully relativistic version. In this case recall
that the non-relativistic expansion for the energy of a particle is
the classical kinetic energy:
#+BEGIN_LaTeX
\begin{equation}
E = \sqrt{M^2+p^2} \simeq M + \frac{p^2}{2M}
\end{equation}
#+END_LaTeX
The separation of short distance interactions of the light quarks and
the long distance interactions of the heavy quarks suggest the
following terms in the NRQCD lagrangian \cite{Bodwin:1994jh}:
#+BEGIN_LaTeX
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{\text{NRQCD}} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{light}} + \mathcal{L}_{\text{heavy}} + \delta\mathcal{L}
\end{equation}
#+END_LaTeX
The light quarks are expected to be adequately described by the QCD
lagrangian, and so those terms are retained:
#+BEGIN_LaTeX
  \begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L}_{\text{light}} = -\frac{1}{2}F^A_{\alpha\beta}F^{\alpha\beta}_A + \sum_{\text{light flavors}}\overline{q}_a(i\slashed{D}-m)_{ab}q_b
  \end{equation}
#+END_LaTeX
The heavy quarks are explicitly inserted using the non-relativistic
expansion of the gauge-covariant derivative:
#+BEGIN_LaTeX
\begin{equation}
i\slashed{D} - m  = i D_t + \frac{\mathbf{D}^2}{2M}
\end{equation}
#+END_LaTeX
This gives:
#+BEGIN_LaTeX
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{\text{heavy}} = \psi^\dagger\left(iD_t + \frac{\mathbf{D}^2}{2M}\right)\psi + \chi^\dagger\left(iD_t - \frac{\mathbf{D}^2}{2m}\right)\chi 
\end{equation}
#+END_LaTeX
Where the color and spin indices have now been supressed and $\psi$ is
the Pauli spinor field responsible for annihilating a heavy quark.
Conversely $\chi$ is the Pauli spinor field for creating a heavy
anti-quark, $D_t$ and $\mathbf{D}$ are the space-time components of
the gauge covariant derivative $D^\mu$.  

These two terms together describe QCD coupled with a Schrödinger
theory for the heavy quarks \cite{Bodwin:1994jh}.  Since the
Schrödinger terms were added as a non-relativistic expansion of the
gauge-covariant derivative additional terms in the expansion must be
included in order to fully describe the relativistic effects of QCD.
These terms are explained in detail in \cite{Bodwin:1994jh} and are
contained in the $\delta\mathcal{L}$ term above.  

Organizing the lagrangian in this way allows cross section formulas to
be written as a dual expansion in the relative velocities of the heavy
quarks and the QCD coupling constant $\alpha_s$.  This gives insight
into which effects dominate at what scale in the short and long
distance interactions.  
** Factorization Theorem
Because this formulation of the lagrangian makes the Schroedinger
states explicit, the quarkonium state can be interpreted as a sum of
all possible Fock state configurations.  This can be written as
\cite{Ellis:1991qj}:
#+BEGIN_LaTeX
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
  |\psi_Q\rangle &= O(1)|Q\overline{Q}[^3S_1^{(1)}]\rangle + O(v) |Q\overline{Q}[^3P_J^{(8)}]g\rangle \\
  &+ O(v^2)|Q\overline{Q}[^1S_0^{(8)}]g\rangle + O(v^2)|Q\overline{Q}[^3S_1^{(1,8)}]gg\rangle \\
  &+ O(v^2)|Q\overline{Q}[^3D_J^{(1,8)}]gg\rangle + \ldots \\

Here $\psi_Q$ is the quarkonium bound state.  The angular momentum
quantum numbers of the Fock state are given in standard spectroscopic
notation: $^{2S+1}L_J^{(1,8)}$ with an additional index to indicate singlet
(1) or octet (8) color states.  In this notation $S$ is the spin of
the system, $L$ is the orbital quantum number and $J$ is the total
angular momentum. This formula also makes explicit the relative
probability of finding a gluon in a $Q\overline{Q}$ state, which was one of
the conditions necessary for the potential model of quarkonium.

The leading order term corresponds to the wavefunction from the
Schroedinger picture.  Higher order terms correspond to Fock states
which provide a soft gluon.  The presence of this gluon in the state
allows the quarkonium to be in a color octet state.  The inclusion of
these terms in the expression for the overall cross section provides
important contributions to the production of quarkonia in hadronic
collisions.  

The explicit formulation of the partonic cross section can be written
as: 
#+BEGIN_LaTeX
  \begin{equation}
  \label{eq:xs_total}
  \frac{d\sigma}{d\hat{t}}(ab \rightarrow Q\overline{Q}[n] c \rightarrow
  \psi_Q) = \frac{1}{16 \pi \hat{s}^2}
  \overline{\sum}\left|\mathcal{A}(ab \rightarrow Q\overline{Q}[n] c)_{\text{short}}\right|^2\langle 0 | O^{\psi_Q}_{8,1}(n) |0 \rangle
  \end{equation}
#+END_LaTeX
Here, $a,b$ and $c$ represent initial and final state partons, $n$ is
shorthand for the spectroscopic term symbol introduced above, and
$\psi_{Q}$ is the final state quarkonium. The sum is understood to be
the average over initial spin and color states of the scattering
amplitudes and the $\langle 0 | O^{\psi_Q}_{8,1}(n) |0 \rangle$ term
(abbreviated as $\mathcal{O}^H_{8,1}(n)$) is the known long distance
matrix element (LDME).

Equation \ref{eq:xs_total} explicitly separates the energy scales
involved in production. Figure \ref{fig:nrqcd-ldme} shows a pictoral
representation of this factorization. The short distance amplitude is
calculated by evaluating the relevant Feynman diagrams required to
produce a $Q\overline{Q}$ pair with quantum numbers $n$. The LDME
(repesented by the grey blob) on the other hand represents the low
energy, non-perturbative part of the calculation.

This value cannot be calculated directly and must be inferred from
experimental measurements. The extraction of LDMEs from globally
measured data has been done many times \cite{Gong:2012ug}
\cite{Butenschoen:2012qr} \cite{Faccioli:2014cqa}, but the methodology
is fraught with pitfalls and there is no definitive set available.
Further, the LDMEs represent a large number of degrees of freedom.
Some components have different momentum dependence, and thus it is
possible to re-weight them to fit the subset of data judged valid by
the person fitting the parameters.

The LDME values extracted are validated using the only degree of
freedom remaining in the quarkonium system: the spin alignment between
the quarkonium and the measured decay products. Historically the
disagreement between the measured spin-alignment and the amount
required by the extracted LDMEs has been referred to as the
"polarization puzzle[fn:: The alliteration seems to have contributed
to the persistency of this name versus the more technically accurate
"spin-alignment inconsistency"]." There have been many attempts at
explaining the effect \cite{Haberzettl:2007kj} \cite{Ma:2010yw}
\cite{Chao:2012iv} \cite{Lansberg:2013wva}, but none are completely
satisfactory.

* Jet fragmentation
Having examined the bound states QCD is capable of producing, it is
now useful examine another aspect of QCD at a different energy scale:
the fate of a recoiling parton in a hard[fn:: Hard here refers to high
energy, conversely soft refers to low energy.] interaction.
Confinement makes it impossible for a parton to propagate through
space without forming a color singlet state. What is needed is a
framework for discussing the transition between a single hard parton
and the shower of hadrons ultimately measured in the detector. 

As in the production of quarkonium states there are two energy scales
which must be separated to make progress with the QCD processes.  The
scale where perturbation theory can be applied is separated into what
is called the parton shower.  The non-perturbative part of the process
is the transition from partons into hadrons referred to as
hadronization.  
** Parton Shower

    \caption{\label{fig:parton-splittings} Feynman vertices that contribute to a parton shower.}
  \end{figure}
#+END_LaTeX
Figure \ref{fig:parton-splittings} shows the various initial and final
state parton configurations which contribute to a parton shower. An
entire shower consists of a series of splittings following different
probability distributions depending on the outgoing partons at each
splitting. The process is dissipative, in the sense that the energy is
shared between the final state partons, and at each branching the
energy of a given parton is less than the previous branching's
daughters.  When the final state partons fall below a certain
threshold the non-perturbative effects of hadronization take over and
the partons form hadrons which are ultimately detected by the
experimental apparatus. 

Each parton splitting functions has characteristic differences that
affect the outcome of the shower.  Following Chapter 5 of
\cite{Ellis:1991qj}, the shower is assumed to follow timelike
branching.  The energy fraction $z$ of branching is defined as:
#+BEGIN_LaTeX
\begin{equation}
z = E_c/E_a = 1 - E_b/E_a
\end{equation}
#+END_LaTeX
After averaging over the possible polarization states of the incoming
and outgoing gluons the amplitude for splitting from $n$ partons to
$n+1$ partons is given by:
#+BEGIN_LaTeX
\begin{equation}
|\mathcal{M}_{n+1}|^2 \sim \frac{4g^2}{t}\hat{P}_{bc}(z)|\mathcal{M}_n|^2
\end{equation}
#+END_LaTeX
Here $g$ is the QCD coupling constant, $t\equiv p_a^2$ and
$\hat{P}_{bc}$ is the unregularized splitting function for the final
state partons. The gluon splitting function corresponding to Figure
\ref{fig:g-to-gg} is:
#+BEGIN_LaTeX
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:gg-split}
\hat{P}_{gg}(z) = C_A\left[\frac{1-z}{z}+\frac{z}{1-z}+z(1-z)\right]
\end{equation}
#+END_LaTeX
Here the color factor is $C_A=3$. It is useful to take the various
limits. Notice that when one of the partons is soft either ($c$ soft)
$z\rightarrow 0$ or ($b$ soft) $z\rightarrow 1$. The first term of
equation \ref{eq:gg-split} is divergent for $z\rightarrow 0$. The same
is true for the second term as $z\rightarrow 1$. These divergences
favor soft emission of gluons.

Following the same prescription, the splitting function for gluon
emission from a quark (see Figure \ref{fig:g-to-qg}):
#+BEGIN_LaTeX
\begin{equation}
\hat{P}_{qg}(z) = T_R[z^2+(1-z)^2]
\end{equation}
#+END_LaTeX
In this case the color factor $T_R=1/2$, taking $z\rightarrow 0$
favors soft gluon emission whereas the $z\rightarrow 1$ limit favors
hard emission of the gluon. The parabolic nature of the function
favors one extreme or the other.

The remaining case corresponds to Figure \ref{fig:g-to-qqbar} and is
for a gluon splitting into a quark anti-quark pair.  The spin-averaged
splitting function is:
#+BEGIN_LaTeX
\begin{equation}
\hat{P}_{qq}(z) = C_F \frac{1+z^2}{1-z}
\end{equation}
#+END_LaTeX
This function is unique among the splitting functions in that it
favors one of the outgoing partons to be harder than the other. Figure
\ref{fig:splitting-functions} shows the three splitting functions
defined above.  An arbitrary normalization is applied to the $P_{qq}$
and $P_gg$ functions in order to better compare the behavior of the
shapes.

The contributions from these individual diagrams and splitting
functions can be used to simulate a parton shower. An example parton
shower from an $e^+e^-$ annihilation event taken from
\cite{Ellis:1991qj} is shown in Figure \ref{fig:parton-shower}.

[[file:figures/parton-shower.eps]] 
** Hadronization
The evolution of the partons created during the shower into hadrons is
inherently non-perturbative.  The phenomenological model used by
Pythia is the Lund string model \cite{Sjostrand:2007gs}.  This model
extends the string analogy developed in Section [[Potential Models of
QCD]].  The idea is that hadrons in the shower are connected via
color-strings.  If the energy stored in the string rises above the
threshold for $q\overline{q}$, the string snaps and the process is
repeated until the energies of the remaining string segments fall
below a threshold value.  Below this threshold, the string fragments
form the final state hadrons.  If there are gluons present in the
final state of the parton shower, they are connected to the
color-strings as dynamical kinks in the string.  Figure
\ref{fig:color-hadronization} shows an example of this process in an
$e^+e^-$ event \cite{Ellis:1991qj}.
#+CAPTION: String model of hadronization in an $e^+e^-$ event. Grey shaded region is the string. Figure taken from \cite{Ellis:1991qj}
#+NAME: fig:color-hadronization
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 0.5\linewidth 
[[file:figures/color_hadronization.eps]] 

Notice that in Figure \ref{fig:color-hadronization} when a gluon is in
the final shower it forms a kink in the string (see the upper part of
the shower). When a gluon splits perturbatively into a pair of quarks
it creates another string segment \cite{Ellis:1991qj}. The lines
outgoing from the grey string segments represent the subsequent
fragmentation of the string as described above.

With a complete description of QCD bound states and the transition
from a high energy parton to the hadrons ultimately measured by the
detector it is time to discuss the actual measurement of particles at
the Large Hadron Collider.

#+LaTeX: \chapter{The ATLAS detector}
#+LaTeX: \label{chap:detector}
* The Large Hadron Collider
The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is the largest (in size and energy)
circular hadron collider in existence. The circumference of the
colliding rings is 26.7 km and is buried between 45 m and 170 m below
parts of Switzerland and France \cite{lhc-machine}. The LHC was built
based on infrastructure developed for the Large Electron Positron
collider and utilizes the CERN accelerator complex in order to boost
protons to the high energies required for circulating in the LHC
tunnel. The LHC circulates beams of protons in opposite directions and
steers them into each other at four points around the accelerator
ring. These four points are the sites of the major LHC experiments,
CMS, ATLAS, LHCb, and ALICE \cite{lhc-machine}. The data for this work
was recorded in 2012 when the machine was configured to run each beam
of protons at 4 TeV each for a center of mass energy $\sqrt{s}=8 TeV$.

In order to collide protons, the LHC accelerates them through a series
of booster rings until they are injected into the main accelerator
complex. Protons injected into the LHC are organized into bunches of
10^11 protons. The bunches are spaced according to frequency (400 MHz)
of the RF cavities which accelerate the particles. During the first
run of the LHC, the bunches were spaced 50 ns apart which is twice the
designed bunch spacing of 25 ns.

In order to achieve this configuration of bunch crossings and precise
control of the proton beams a number of problems must be addressed.
Foremost is the bending the protons around the ring. This is achieved
using 1,232 superconducting magnetic dipoles \cite{lhc-machine}. Each
of these dipoles is operated at 1.9 K and produce a field strength of
8 T. The operating temperature of the magnets has a tight margin above
which the superconductivity is lost and the magnet ceases to conduct
\cite{lhc-machine}. This transition is known as quenching, and when it
occurs all of the energy stored in the field is released. An
unintended quench in 2008 led to a massive helium explosion and
delayed the experiment by a year.

Another aspect that is important to the smooth operation of the LHC is
the vacuum in the beam pipe. In order to maximize beam lifetime and
minimize experimental backgrounds the beam pipe must be kept as
pristine as possible. This equates to a vacuum pressure of 10^{-10}
mbar. In the regions around the experiments the vacuum is designed to
keep the density of hydrogen below 10^13 H_2 m^{-3}. As a point of
reference the volume of beampipe contained by the ATLAS detector is
roughly 0.008 m^3. This means that there is roughly $8\times 10^{10}$
hydrogen atoms in the ATLAS beampipe at any given time. The same
volume of hydrogen gas at STP results in $2.15\times 10^{24}$ atoms.
This is a change in concentration of roughly 30 parts per quadrillion.

** Luminosity
Many of the measurements made at the LHC boil down to counting
experiments answering the question: "How many particles with
properties $x$, $y$, and $z$ do I see?" These properties may be the
transverse momentum ($p_T$), invariant mass ($m$), or rapidity ($y$).
The experimental physicist reconstructs events, selects those matching
the required criteria and compares the number counted to a theoretical
calculation.  

Conversely, a theoretical physicist calculates the number of observed
particles with given properties $x$, $y$ and $z$ by starting with
incoming protons and working out the probability of observing the
expected particles. The proton beams are characterized by a parameter
called the luminosity $L$ of the beam which is the particles passing
per second per unit area. When a theoretical physicist calculates the
cross sectional area[fn:: This quantity has SI units of cm^2 but barns
are most commonly used in the field. The name comes from the saying
"you couldn't hit the broad side of a barn" and originated during
research into the atomic bomb \cite{unc-dict}. Another unit from this
era is the "shake" as in "two shakes of a lamb's tail" which is 10 ns,
a convenient unit of measure in nuclear reactions \cite{unc-dict}. ]
of a process ($\sigma(pp\rightarrow A B)$ where $A$ and $B$ are
outgoing particle species), the rate of particles produced is given by
the product of the luminosity and the cross section:
#+BEGIN_LaTeX
\begin{equation*}
dN/dt = L(t) \sigma(pp \rightarrow A B)
\end{equation*}
#+END_LaTeX
In order to predict the absolute number of events, this expression
must be integrated over the time that data was collected:
#+BEGIN_LaTeX
\begin{equation*}
N = \sigma \int L(t)dt
\end{equation*}
#+END_LaTeX
The amount of data collected by the experiment is measured in the
integrated luminosity. It has units of inverse barns which is
convenient for back-of-the-envelope calculations of the expected
number of events for a process: take the product of the data collected
and the expected cross section to get the number of events.

The instantaneous luminosity $L$ of the LHC is given by the following
formula:
#+BEGIN_LaTeX
\begin{equation}
L = \frac{N_b^2n_b f_{\text{rev}}\gamma_r}{4\pi \epsilon_n \beta^*}F
\end{equation}
#+END_LaTeX
The denominator of this equation is fairly straightforward, $N_b$ is
the number of protons per bunch (typically $N_b\sim10^11$), $n_b$ is
the number of bunches per beam, $f_{\text{rev}}$ is the revolution
frequency of the machine, $\gamma_r$ is the relativistic gamma factor
for the bunches and $F$ is a geometric factor to account for the
geometry of the crossing angle at the interaction point (IP). The
denominator must be a unit of area from dimensional analysis. The
transverse beam emittance is given by $\epsilon_n$ and $\beta^*$ is
the value of the $\beta$ function at the IP. The two parameters
$\epsilon_n$ and $\beta$ describe the major and semi-major axes of an
ellipse which describes the transverse phase-space profile of the LHC
beam. Together they describe the effective area of the beam at the IP
\cite{lhc-machine}.

The geometric factor $F$ can be worked out from small angle
approximations as well as the RMS length and transverse width of the
beam:
#+BEGIN_LaTeX
\begin{equation}
F = \left(1 + \left(\frac{\theta_c\sigma_z}{2\sigma^*}\right)^2\right)^{-1/2}
\end{equation}
#+END_LaTeX
Here $\theta_c$ is the crossing angle, $\sigma_z$ is the RMS length of
a bunch crossing and $\sigma^*$ is the transverse RMS beam size for a
gaussian beam.  

When the beams cross, there is a high probability that multiple high
energy interactions take place. The interaction which is selected for
study is referred to as the primary interaction. Secondary
interactions contribute to experimental background, they are called
pileup. The degree of pileup can be measure by the average number of
interactions per bunch crossing ($<\mu>$). For the data used in this
thesis, the pileup was 20 interactions per bunch crossing on average.
Pileup presents an experimental challenge because the particles
produced in association with the events can confuse the reconstruction
algorithms used. This analysis makes use of reconstructed quantities
that are largely insensitive to pileup effects.


* The ATLAS detector
A Toroidal LHC AparatuS (ATLAS[fn:: ATLHCA doesn't have the same ring,
or status as a greek titan]) is one of the general purpose detectors
at the LHC. It is located at Point 1 on the LHC ring. Figure
\ref{fig:atlas-detector} shows a high level drawing of the detector,
the detector itself is 44m long and 25 m tall[fn:: The detector weighs
approximately 7000 tonnes. If the volume the detector contains were
hermetically sealed, the density of the detector would allow it to
float if it were put in fresh water.]. The ATLAS detector contains
many detector subsystems which allow it to detect and reconstruct
particles which are created during collisions at the IP. The detectors
all work on the principal that when a charged particle moves through
matter it either radiates energy in the form of Brehmsstrahlung or it
ionizes the surrounding matter. In the former case, the radiation can
be detected directly, or it can produce a positron and electron pair
(pair production) which can subsequently detected. Different parts of
the detector exploit these two processes in different ways. The
electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters work to stop electrons and
hadrons while accurately measuring the energy of the incident
particle. Tracking elements aim to accurately detect the time and
location where a charged particle passes and do so in different ways. 
#+CAPTION: A cutaway of the ATLAS detector.  Two small people are shown to scale.
#+NAME: fig:atlas-detector
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 1.0\linewidth 
[[file:figures/full_atlas_detector.jpeg]] 

In order to accurately measure the charge and momentum of particles
passing through the detector, a set of magnets is used to bend the
charged particles. ATLAS uses a unique configuration of a 2.0 T
solenoid covering the inner detector and a toroidal configuration of 8
superconducting yokes which provide a field between 0.5 T and 0.5 T
\cite{atlas-detector}. The central solenoid ensures that charged
particles bend in the transverse plane of the inner detector. The
toroidal configuration of the outer magnets bend the muons which exit
the hadronic calorimeter, allowing for a precise measurement of the
three spatial components of their momentum. Together these systems
allow the measurement of the particles four momentum and charge. This
analysis exclusively uses charged particle tracks in the form of muon
identified tracks, and inner detector tracks. This was done in order
to minimize various systematic effects that will be discussed.

ATLAS uses a right-handed cylindrical coordinate system with the
$z$-axis oriented along the beam line, see \ref{fig:coord-system} for
details. In cartesian coordinates, the $x$ and $y$ axes are in the
plane transverse to the beam line. The $x$ axis points to the center
of the ring and the $y$ axis points to the Earth's surface. A useful
quantity for describing angles in the detector is pseudorapidity
($\eta$)[fn:: Differences in pseudorapidity are invariant in
relativistic boosts along the beam axis which is very useful
experimentally. ]

** Inner Detector
Figure \ref{fig:inner-detector} shows the inner detector at ATLAS with
each subsystem labeled. Figure \ref{fig:inner-detector-slice} shows a
view of the inner detector for a wedge of the detector. Working radially outward from the IP, the
ATLAS inner detector is comprised of three main components: the pixel
detector (extending 45.5 mm $< R <$ 242 mm), the silicon strip
detector (SCT) (extending 255 mm $< R <$ 549 mm), and the transition
radiation tracker (TRT) (extending 554 mm $< R <$ 1082 mm). The pixel
detector and SCT function based on semi-conductor technologies that
allow them to measure the location of charged particles with high
precision. The TRT operates based on transition radiation, a
phenomenon that occurs when charged particles traverse different
materials. During the transition between materials particles are very
likely to emit radiation which is subsequently detected.

*** Semiconductor based detectors
The pixel detector and the silicon strip tracker utilize the
ionization of matter as charged particles pass through the active
regions. The active region of the detectors is constructed by forming
a layer of n-doped and p-doped semiconductor. These layers are held at
a fixed voltage. When a charged particle traverses the active region,
the ionized material becomes conducting allowing for the location of
the particle to be determined. Figure \ref{fig:pixel-schematic} shows
a schematic of a pixel. The bottom half of the schematic is the
sensing region and the dark grey and lighter grey regions represent
the doped semiconductor. The bump-bond indicates a fabrication
technique utilized to provide uniform attachment of each
micro-fabricated pixel to the readout electronics.

[[file:figures/pixel-cartoon.eps]] 

*** Pixel Detector
The fundamental unit of the pixel detector is a module. Figure
\ref{fig:module-overview} shows the various layers that go into the a
pixel module. A module consists of readout electronics and active
pixel sensors which detect the position of charged particles. Each
module has a sensitive surface $6.08 \times 1.64 \text{cm}^2$
\cite{pixel-detector}. Each module consists of 47232 pixels
\cite{pixel-detector}. The entire pixel detector is constructed from
1744 modules \cite{pixel-detector}. These modules are arranged in
three concentric cylinders. The forward region of the detector is
covered by three rings of end-cap modules on either end of the pixel
barrel region. The geometric arrangement of the modules can be seen
the green components in Figure \ref{fig:inner-detector-slice}.
